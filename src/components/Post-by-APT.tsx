          The post trains got so popular, that in 1959, the Regie der Posterijen
          and the NMBS agreed to start using{" "}
          <span className="p--bold">Autonomous Post Trains (APT).</span> Instead
          of attaching the post carriage to a passenger train, the post would be
          transported by special post trains. This way, the post trains could
          <span className="p--bold">choose</span> their own routes and{" "}
          <span className="p--bold">timetables.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          8 years later, the NMBS started converting AM35 passenger trains into
          8 two-cart post trains in the workshop in Mechelen. By having two
          carts, the travelling post men could{" "}
          <span className="p--bold">keep the post in</span> one cart and{" "}
          <span className="p--bold">sort the post in</span>
          the other. This made the job much safer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first APT, between Namen and Libramont, was inaugurated in 1968.
          That same year, the route between Ghent and Ostend started using APTâ€™s
          as well. Until 1981, there were{" "}
          <span className="p--bold">12 travelling post trains</span> and around{" "}
          <span className="p--bold">300 people</span> working on or around them.
