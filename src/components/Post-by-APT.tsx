            8 years later, the NMBS started converting AM35 passenger trains
            into 8 two-cart post trains in the workshop in Mechelen. By having
            two carts, the travelling post men could{" "}
            <span className="p--bold">keep the post in</span> one cart and{" "}
            <span className="p--bold">sort the post in</span> the other. This

              The first APT, between Namen and Libramont, was inaugurated in
              1968. That same year, the route between Ghent and Ostend started
              using APTâ€™s as well. Until 1981, there were{" "}
