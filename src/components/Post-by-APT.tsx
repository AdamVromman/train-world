            8 years later, the NMBS started converting AM35 passenger trains
            into 8 two-cart post trains in the workshop in Mechelen. By having
            two carts, the travelling post men could{" "}
            <span className="p--bold">keep the post in</span> one cart and{" "}
            <span className="p--bold">sort the post in</span>
            the other. This made the job much safer.

              The first APT, between Namen and Libramont, was inaugurated in
              1968. That same year, the route between Ghent and Ostend started
              using APTâ€™s as well. Until 1981, there were{" "}
