          One of the reasons that the train post kept growing was{" "}
          <span className="p--bold">the birth of the prepaid stamp.</span> This
          meant that more people started sending mail than ever before! After
          1950, every train station had to have a postbox and after 1952, a
          kiosk to sell stamps.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most important job was to{" "}
          <span className="p--bold">
            lighten the job of the fixed post offices.
          </span>{" "}
          They also delivered the most urgent mail. The trains were so fast that
          a letter, send at the last possible moment of the day, would reach its
          destination the next day. Across the whole country!
        </p>

          It wasn’t easy to be a travelling postman. During the day, the post
          trains stood still. But once the sun set and the train arrived at its
          first station, the postmen got to work.{" "}
          <span className="p--bold">Every station</span>, they received the huge
          bags with <span className="p--bold">unsorted post.</span> Before they
          got to the next station, they had to sort all the mail.
        </p>
        <p>
          During those years, trains made a lot of{" "}
          <span className="p--bold">loud noise</span> the whole time and the
          lamps didn’t always work. In those cases, they had to use candles.
          Working with fire in a moving train is definitely not safe, and{" "}
          <span className="p--bold">small injuries</span> were{" "}
          <span className="p--bold">not uncommon.</span> But even with all of
          this discomfort and danger, the post was always sorted on time!
